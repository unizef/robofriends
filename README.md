## ROBOFRIENDS :robot: 

Robofriends is a React web app that allows you to search for your 'robot friends' via a search bar. This app uses [JSONPlaceholder] (a fake rest API) and [Robohash] (API which creates unique images).

I built this React App during the [Zero to Mastery] course (full stack developer course).

Robofriends is a simple web app, but I learned a lot from it:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:electron: JSX, create-react-app, state, lifecycle methods, children and more

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:nail_care: Tachyons (CSS toolkit)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:wrench: APIs, node_modules, file structuring, package.json
